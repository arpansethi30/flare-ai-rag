Classify the following user input into EXACTLY ONE category. Analyze carefully and
choose the most specific matching category.

Categories (in order of precedence):
1. RAG_RESPONDER
   • Use when input is a clear question about Flare Networks, blockchain technology, or related aspects
   • Queries that can be answered with factual information from documentation
   • Keywords: flare, blockchain, oracle, crypto, smart contract, staking, consensus, gas, node
   • Examples: "What is Flare?", "How does staking work?", "Tell me about Flare's oracle"

2. REQUEST_ATTESTATION
   • Keywords: attestation, verify, prove, check enclave
   • Must specifically request verification or attestation
   • Related to security or trust verification

3. CONVERSATIONAL (default)
   • Use when input doesn't clearly match above categories
   • General questions, greetings, or unclear requests
   • Any ambiguous or multi-category inputs

Input: ${user_input}

Instructions:
- Choose ONE category only
- For ANY query mentioning Flare or blockchain concepts, use RAG_RESPONDER
- Select most specific matching category
- Default to CONVERSATIONAL if unclear
- Ignore politeness phrases or extra context
- Focus on core intent of request

Response format:
Return ONLY the category name, nothing else. Example: "RAG_RESPONDER"

RAG_ROUTER: Final = """
Analyze the query provided and classify it into EXACTLY ONE category from the following
options:

    1. ANSWER: Use this if the query is clear, specific, and can be answered with
    factual information. Relevant queries must have at least some vague link to
    the Flare Network blockchain.
    2. CLARIFY: Use this if the query is ambiguous, vague, or needs additional context.
    3. REJECT: Use this if the query is inappropriate, harmful, or completely
    out of scope. Reject the query if it is not related at all to the Flare Network
    or not related to blockchains.

Input: ${user_input}

Response format:
{
  "classification": "<UPPERCASE_CATEGORY>"
}

Processing rules:
- The response should be exactly one of the three categories
- DO NOT infer missing values
- Normalize response to uppercase

Examples:
- "What is Flare's block time?" → {"category": "ANSWER"}
- "How do you stake on Flare?" → {"category": "ANSWER"}
- "How is the weather today?" → {"category": "REJECT"}
- "What is the average block time?" - No specific chain is mentioned.
   → {"category": "CLARIFY"}
- "How secure is it?" → {"category": "CLARIFY"}
- "Tell me about Flare." → {"category": "CLARIFY"}

1. Requirements for the users attestation request:
   - The user must provide a single random message
   - Message length must be between 10-74 characters
   - Message can include letters and numbers
   - No additional text or instructions should be included

2. Format requirements:
   - The user must send ONLY the random message in their next response

3. Verification process:
   - After receiving the attestation response, the user should https://jwt.io
   - They should paste the complete attestation response into the JWT decoder
   - They should verify that the decoded payload contains your exact random message
   - They should confirm the TEE signature is valid
   - They should check that all claims in the attestation response are present and valid
