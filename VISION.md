# Flare AI RAG: Enhanced Knowledge System

## Vision
Our vision was to create an intelligent, comprehensive knowledge system that could serve as an authoritative source for Flare Network information, capable of handling complex technical queries while maintaining accuracy and context.

## Core Improvements

### 1. Knowledge Base Enhancement
- **Expanded Data Sources**
  - Flare Documentation Hub
  - Technical Protocol Specifications
  - Developer Documentation
  - GitHub Repositories
  - Network Architecture Documents

- **Data Quality**
  - Semantic chunking for context preservation
  - Metadata-rich document processing
  - Cross-reference capability
  - Version-aware documentation

### 2. Technical Architecture

#### Data Collection System
- **Web Scraper Implementation**
  ```python
  SOURCES = [
      {"url": "https://docs.flare.network/", "name": "Flare Documentation"},
      {"url": "https://github.com/flare-foundation", "name": "Flare GitHub"},
      {"url": "https://flare.network/", "name": "Flare Website"},
      {"url": "https://docs.flare.network/dev/", "name": "Flare Developer Hub"}
  ]
  ```
- Configurable depth and scope
- Intelligent link following
- Metadata extraction
- Content categorization

#### Document Processing
- **Semantic Chunking**
  - Preserves document structure
  - Maintains context between sections
  - Smart overlap for coherence
  - Size optimization for retrieval

- **Metadata Enhancement**
  ```python
  @dataclass
  class DocumentMetadata:
      source_name: str
      source_url: str
      title: str | None
      description: str | None
      version: str | None
      last_updated: str | None
  ```

### 3. Response Quality Improvements
